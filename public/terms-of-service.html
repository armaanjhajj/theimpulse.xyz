                    These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a binding agreement between you ("you," "User") and Impulse Labs, Inc. ("Impulse," "we"). By accessing or using our Website, App, or Wearable (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-8 font-semibold">

                <p>
                    Impulse helps you discover compatible people nearby, act in the moment, and confirm connections only if you meet in person (e.g., via a band tap or in‑app confirmation). We may offer an optional Wearable (Impulse Band™) that lights up to indicate status/mood and enables quick contact exchange.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">2. ELIGIBILITY</h2>

                    You must be 18+, able to form a contract, and not prohibited from using the Services under applicable law.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">3. ACCOUNT & SECURITY</h2>

                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Impulse will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.

                <p>
                    You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for any reason, including violations of these Terms. Sections intended to survive termination will survive.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION; CLASS WAIVER</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> Except for small‑claims matters or equitable relief for IP/security, disputes will be resolved by final and binding arbitration on an individual basis. No class actions or representative proceedings. The Federal Arbitration Act governs this section. Venue for any court proceedings (e.g., to confirm an award) will be New York County, New York.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Opt‑Out:</strong> You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of first acceptance by emailing info@theimpulse.xyz with subject "Arbitration Opt‑Out," your name, and the phone number tied to your account.
